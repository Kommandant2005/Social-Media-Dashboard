### What I Learned

While working on this project, I enhanced my understanding of:

- Implementing dark and light theme toggling with React and Styled Components.
- Creating a responsive layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
- Using Next.js for better performance and SEO.

```js
const toggleTheme = () => {
  setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light');
};
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve accessibility by adding ARIA attributes.
- Implement additional animations for better user experience.
- Optimize performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders.
